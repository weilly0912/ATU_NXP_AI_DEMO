Warning: Unsupported TensorFlow Lite semantics for ARG_MAX 'ArgMax'. Placing on CPU instead
 - Scalar Input tensors are only valid for op type: ADD, EXPAND_DIMS, MAXIMUM, MEAN, MINIMUM, MUL, QUANTIZE, SPLIT, SPLIT_V, SUB
   Op has scalar input tensor(s): ArgMax/dimension
Warning: Unsupported TensorFlow Lite semantics for RESHAPE 'ReshapedArgMax'. Placing on CPU instead
 - Input(s), Output and Weight tensors must have quantization parameters
   Op has tensors with missing quantization parameters: ArgMax, ReshapedArgMax
Warning: RESIZE_BILINEAR 'bilinear/predict_labels_0' is not supported on the NPU. Placing on CPU instead
 - The width and height of the IFM and OFM must match one of the following criteria:
        IFM W and H must both be 1
        IFM must match OFM
        W and H scaling must be equal and OFM W-1 and H-1 must be 2x/4x/8x IFM W-1 and H-1, if align_corners is True
        W and H scaling must be equal and OFM W and H must be 2x/4x/8x IFM W and H, if align_corners is False
   Op has ifm_shape=[1, 16, 16, 21], ofm_shape=[1, 256, 256, 21] and align_corners=True
Warning: AVERAGE_POOL_2D 'AvgPool2D/AvgPool' is not supported on the NPU. Placing on CPU instead
 - Stride values for both width and height must be in the range [1, 3]
   Op has stride WxH as: 16x16
Warning: ArgMax operation is unknown or unsupported, placing on CPU
Warning: ResizeBilinear operation is unknown or unsupported, placing on CPU
Warning: AvgPool operation is unknown or unsupported, placing on CPU
